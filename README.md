# Based on the projection of a biological specimen (e.g., CT scans, MRIs, and X-ray images.). A widely used reconstruction technique is the transform method, in particular filtered back projection (FBP). Although FBP is highly respected for its speed and ease of implementation, it usually produces low-quality, blurred images, especially when dealing with incomplete or noisy data. The aim of this project is to learn and document various methods for biospecimen reconstruction. After that, develop advanced computational techniques to generate high quality reconstructed images with improved clarity and accuracy. The images for this project are mainly generated using C++ language.
